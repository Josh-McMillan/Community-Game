# Community-Game

We're working on a game! More details to come...

# Game Wiki

The wiki is hosted [here](https://github.com/Josh-McMillan/Community-Game/wiki). It contains a formatted GDD, as well as any other necessary documentation, and is headed by Alex.

# Design Doc

*Note: We are currently in the process of moving the GDD over into the Wiki.*

The GDD is hosted [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1evibPdFZQEfdCYkomW6fOHJvpTXfDxutHBMMQXUKNUs/edit). Please keep it up to date and keep yourself up to date with changes. Any changes made will continue to be ported over to the wiki.
